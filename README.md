# Introduction-to-Deep-Learning-with-Keras


In order to learn Keras better we will set-up an exercise we are going to solve in this post. 

Problem Statement: Imagine a meteor is approaching the earth and a group of scientists is trying to estimate the orbit by using historical data gathered about previous orbits of similar meteors.

Scientists have used this data alongside their knowledge to estimate an 80-minute orbit, that is, an orbit from -40 minutes to +40 minutes. t=0 corresponds to the time of crossing the impact region. It looks like the meteor will be close! 

We have data for the path a previous meteor took during a period of 20 minutes, 10 minutes before and 10 minutes after crossing the impact region. We will train a model on this data and then extrapolate our predictions to an 80-minute orbit to see how it compares to the scientists prediction.
